Track daily and total visits on your blog posts. Display the count as well as popular and trending posts.

== Description ==

WordPress doesn't have an in-built system to track page views or displaying popular posts. [Top 10](https://webberzone.com/plugins/top-10/) is an easy to use, yet, powerful WordPress plugin that will count the number of page views of your posts, pages and any custom post types. You can then display the page view counts as well as display your most popular posts.

Top 10 will add a widget that you can use to display the popular posts list.

Although several similar plugins exist today, Top 10 is one of the most feature rich popular post plugins with support for thumbnails, shortcodes, widgets, custom post types and CSS styles. The inbuilt caching system also helps reduce server load by caching your popular posts output. The tracking uses ajax and is thus compatible with most popular caching plugins.

Top 10 also has powerful API and is fully extendable with WordPress actions and filters to allow you easily extend the code base to add new features or tweak existing ones.

= Features =

* **Page counter**: Counts page views on single posts, pages and *custom post types* on an hourly basis which can then be easily displayed automatically, using shortcodes or functions
* **Popular posts**: Display a list of popular posts either for total counts or for a custom period. You can choose how many posts are to be displayed along with loads of other customisation options
* **Widget ready**: Sidebar widgets available for daily popular and overall popular posts. Highly customizable widgets to control what you want to display in the list of posts
* **Shortcodes**: The plugin includes two shortcodes `[tptn_list]` and `[tptn_views]` to display the posts list and the number of views respectively
* **Thumbnail support**
	* Support for WordPress post thumbnails. Top 10 will create a custom image size (`tptn_thumbnail`) with the dimensions specified in the Settings page
	* Auto-extract the first image in your post to be displayed as a thumbnail
	* Manually enter the URL of the thumbnail via [WordPress meta fields](http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Fields). Specify this using the meta box in your Edit screens.
* **Exclusions**: Exclude posts from select categories from appearing in the top posts list. Also exclude posts by ID from appearing in the list
* **Styles**: The output is wrapped in CSS classes which allows you to easily style the list. You can enter your custom CSS styles from within WordPress Admin area or use the style included.
* **Admin interface**: View list of daily and/or overall popular posts from within the dashboard. Top 10 also adds two sortable columns to your All Posts and All Pages pages in your WordPress Admin area
* **Works with caching plugins** like WP-Super-Cache, W3 Total Cache or Quick Cache
* **Extendable code**: Top 10 has tonnes of filters and actions that allow any developer to easily add features, edit outputs, etc.

It is the fastest way to get support as I monitor the forums regularly. I also provide [premium *paid* support via email](https://webberzone.com/support/).


= How can I customise the output? =

Several customization options are available via the Settings page in WordPress Admin. You can access this via <strong>Settings &raquo; Top 10</strong>

The main CSS classes include:

* **tptn_posts** and **tptn_posts_daily**: Class of the main wrapper `div`. If you are displaying the related posts on non-singular pages, then you should style this

* **tptn_title**: Class of the `span` tag for title of the post

* **tptn_excerpt**: Class of the `span` tag for excerpt (if included)

* **tptn_thumb**: Class of the post thumbnail `img` tag

* **tptn_list_count**: Class of the `span` tag for post count in top posts list

* **tptn_counter**: Class of the `div` tag that wraps the post count that is driven by the field "Format to display the count in: " under 'Output Options'

= Shortcodes =

`[tptn_list]` lets you insert the popular posts anywhere in your post content. It takes three main optional attributes `limit`, `heading` and `daily` as follows:

*limit* : Maximum number of posts to return. The actual number displayed may be lower depending on the category / post exclusion settings.

*heading* : Set to 0 to disable the heading specified in **Title of popular posts:** under **Output options**

*daily* : If set to 1, then the shortcode will return the daily popular posts list

In addition to these attributes, the shortcode can take all the options as attributes. To see the detailed list take a look at the function `tptn_default_options()` in **top-10.php** file


`[tptn_views]` lets you display the number of visits. The plugin takes one optional attribute `daily` as follows:

*daily* : If set to 1, then the shortcode will return the number of _daily_ views


= Manual install =

The below functions need to be added by editing your theme files where you wish to display them.

Display the post count with `<?php if ( function_exists( 'echo_tptn_post_count' ) ) { echo_tptn_post_count(); } ?>`

Display the overall most popular posts with `<?php if ( function_exists( 'tptn_show_pop_posts' ) ) { tptn_show_pop_posts(); } ?>`

Display the daily/custom period popular posts with `<?php if ( function_exists( 'tptn_show_daily_pop_posts' ) ) { tptn_show_daily_pop_posts(); } ?>`

You can also use the WordPress Widgets to display the popular posts in your sidebar / other widgetized areas of your theme

= Can this plugin replace Google Analytics? =

No. Top 10 has been designed to only track the number of page-views on your blog posts and display the same. It isn't designed to replace Google Analytics or any other full fledged statistics application.

= How does the scheduled maintenance work? =

When you enabled the scheduled maintenance, Top 10 will create a cron job that will run at a predefined interval and clean up old entries from the `wp_top_ten_daily` table.
*Note: If you enable this option, WordPress will execute this job when it is scheduled the first time*

= How to make the columns on the Custom Post Type admin pages sortable? =
Add the following code to your functions.php file of your theme.

`
add_filter( 'manage_edit-{$cpt}_sortable_columns', 'tptn_column_register_sortable' );
`

Replace `{$cpt}` by the slug of your custom post type. E.g. to make the columns on your 'projects' post type sortable, you will need to add:
`
add_filter( 'manage_edit-projects_sortable_columns', 'tptn_column_register_sortable' );
`
